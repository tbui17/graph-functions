##  Overview

Utility library for operating on the [Graphology](https://graphology.github.io/) graph data structure.

- Notable features
  - getGraphEdgesOfType / getGraphNodesOfType - Presumes that the graph is typed and has a a discriminant field ```type``` on both node and edge attributes. Returns all node or edge entries containing that type in its attributes, automatically narrowing down the range of possible types.
  - bfsGraph - Iterator for breadth-first search on a graph, provides a context with convenience properties (eg. path) and methods for contextualized graph query methods (e.g filterEdgeEntries automatically provides the previous and current node as arguments to the method.)
  - unweightedSteinerSubgraph - Retrieves smallest subgraph containing all specified terminal nodes, disregarding weight.
  - InferGraph - Utility type extracting the node, edge, or graph attribute type from a base generic graph type.

The Graph-Functions repository is a TypeScript-based library focused on providing a suite of utilities for graph data structure management and analysis. It simplifies complex operations such as traversal, search, and pathfinding within graphs for developers. The project's main value lies in its ability to offer ready-to-use, efficient algorithms that cater to common graph-related tasks, potentially saving time and reducing errors in applications like network analysis, route optimization, and social network dynamics.
