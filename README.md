## 📍 Overview



Lodash-like functions with an emphasis on type inference. Cuts down on boilerplate involved with defining repetitive DTO types or type guard assertions associated with data transformations. Most notable functions include:

- mergeByPattern: Receives a Zod pattern and recursively matches subpatterns within a complex tree structure such as configuration files, nested Prisma objects, or GraphQL queries, then merges the object provided by the callback function into the matched subpatterns. Automatically infers context received by the callback function as well as the result of the merge operation.
- mapPartition: Define a key value map of filtering functions (with context type inferred) and partition an array of union items into subsets associated with the defined key.
- reduceToObject: Similar to reduce. Return a key value tuple within the callback to assign the result to a key.
- getTreeNodes: Returns an array of all nodes from a tree structure and infers the union type of its nodes.

Also includes tree traversal iterators including BFS and a specialized version of post-order DFS with an API designed to help facilitate safe tree mutation operations.

The Iteration Utilities TypeScript library provides numerous functions for processing arrays and objects including flattening objects, creating Cartesian products, set merging, pattern matching, picking elements to arrays, and array reductions. It also offers utilities for tree traversal operations such as Breadth-First Search (BFS), post-order depth-first search, and tree context processing. These utilities are useful for developers who manipulate data structures often. The library is conveniently organized and exported from an index file and uses Changesets for release management.

|----|--------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ⚙️ | **Architecture**   | The codebase adopts a modular architecture, housing distinct features in dedicated directories within the `src` directory. Script files are organized based on their functionality, with a focus on utility creation. |
| 📄 | **Documentation**  | The codebase contains JSDocs documenting the use of each function. |
| 🔗 | **Dependencies**   | The project is dependent on several libraries such as `lodash`, `zod`, `ts-toolbelt`, and `type-fest` for utility functions, data validation, types enhancement, and TypeScript support.|
| 🧩 | **Modularity**     | The repository shows high modularity with the codebase divided into individual, interchangeably usable utility files like `mappers.ts`, `reduce.ts`, and `mergeSets.ts`.|
| 🧪 | **Testing**        | The repository uses Vitest for the testing framework and the tests are located in [src/tests/](src/tests/)|
| ⚡️ | **Performance**    | Performance analysis is infeasible as it's a utility library. However, the use of efficient algorithms like the two-pointer technique suggests that performance has been considered.|
| 🔐 | **Security**       | The codebase doesn't seem to implement extensive security measures; it's the consumers' responsibility to handle data security when using the utilities of the library.|
| 🔀 | **Version Control**| The repository incorporates a well-structured Git history and uses changesets for release version management. Also, its GitHub Actions workflows demonstrate proper CI/CD implementation.|
| 🔌 | **Integrations**   | The project doesn't include third-party integrations other than the developer dependencies specified in the `package.json` file.|
| 📶 | **Scalability**    | As a utilities library, the scalability of individual utilities will depend on the computational complexity of each utility function.|

| [flatObj.ts](https://github.com/tbui17/iteration-utilities/blob/main/src/flatObj.ts)           | The code defines a helper function `flatObj` that flattens nested JavaScript objects or arrays of objects based on a provided key. It merges properties of the nested item (object or objects in an array) into its parent. If there are key conflicts, nested items' properties take precedence. If the key points to an array of primitive values, each value is added to a copy of the parent object. This function could be used to flatten complex data structures.                                                                                                                                            |
| [twoPointer.ts](https://github.com/tbui17/iteration-utilities/blob/main/src/twoPointer.ts)     | The provided code contains a TypeScript module with three exported utility functions (twoPointerEach, twoPointerMap, twoPointerMapFilter). All three apply a two-pointer technique on an array, premiering a callback function to every pair of elements. twoPointerEach executes a callback for each pair, twoPointerMap applies a callback to each pair then returns the results, while twoPointerMapFilter applies a callback to each pair and returns the results only for non-undefined values.                                                                                                                |
| [pickToArray.ts](https://github.com/tbui17/iteration-utilities/blob/main/src/pickToArray.ts)   | The provided code is a TypeScript function named pickToArray from the iteration-utilities package. It picks specified properties from an object and returns them as an array. The function utilizes generics to work with objects (T), keys (TKey), and an array of keys (TKeys), facilitating flexibility in handling multiple data types. The picked properties are then mapped into a new array and returned.                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| [product.ts](https://github.com/tbui17/iteration-utilities/blob/main/src/product.ts)           | This TypeScript module exports a function that takes in two arrays, applies a calculation to create the Cartesian product of these arrays, and returns an array of tuples. Each tuple contains an element from each input array.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| [mergeSets.ts](https://github.com/tbui17/iteration-utilities/blob/main/src/mergeSets.ts)       | The provided code is a function named mergeSets in a TypeScript project with a structured directory. It merges multiple sets into a single unique set. It takes an array or an iterable of sets as input and returns a new set containing all unique elements from the input sets. It employs a reducer for the merge operation. This function can be found in the mergeSets.ts file inside the src directory.                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| [patternMatch.ts](https://github.com/tbui17/iteration-utilities/blob/main/src/patternMatch.ts) | The code contains mergeByPattern and replaceByPattern functions that use post-order depth-first search to modify objects that match Zod-pattern specified. The mergeByPattern merges additional properties from a callback function to each matching object, while replaceByPattern replaces each nested matching object with a new one from a callback function. Both functions offer an option to perform the operation on a clone of the original object.                                                                                                                                                        |
| [reduce.ts](https://github.com/tbui17/iteration-utilities/blob/main/src/reduce.ts)             | The code defines two TypeScript functions: reduceToMultiObject and reduceToObject. reduceToMultiObject reduces an array into an object that groups array elements into arrays based on a provided mapping function. reduceToObject converts an array into an object with properties defined by a mapping function. Both functions utilize generics and TypeScript's mapped types for flexibility encompassing various data types and structures.                                                                                                                                                                    |
| [index.ts](https://github.com/tbui17/iteration-utilities/blob/main/src/index.ts)               | The provided code is part of a TypeScript project revolving around iteration utilities. Its main modules offer functionalities like creating flat objects (`flatObj`), mapping values (`mappers`), merging sets (`mergeSets`), pattern matching (`patternMatch`), picking elements to an array (`pickToArray`), product computation (`product`), array reduction (`reduce`), tree traversal (`treeWalker`), and implementing the two-pointer technique (`twoPointer`). These utilities are all exported from the `index.ts` file located in the `src/` directory.                                                   |
| [mappers.ts](https://github.com/tbui17/iteration-utilities/blob/main/src/mappers.ts)           | The code contains several utility functions written in TypeScript for mapping and filtering arrays. `mapFilter` applies a function to each array element and returns a new array with the transformed values, excluding `undefined`. `mapFind` returns the first defined value from applying a function to each array element. `mapGroups` applies multiple functions to an array and returns an object where each key corresponds to the function results. `mapPartition` separates an array into subsets based on filtering functions. `mapTupleToObject` transforms a tuple into an object using provided enums. |

| [utils.ts](https://github.com/tbui17/iteration-utilities/blob/main/src/treeWalker/utils.ts)   | The code represents a part of a TypeScript project with scripts for handling array or object manipulations. It comprises a module utils.ts within the treeWalker directory. This file defines utility functions to determine if a variable is an object or array, get the entries or values of an array or object, and establish a number schema using zod library for data validation and parsing.                                                                                                                                  |
| [types.ts](https://github.com/tbui17/iteration-utilities/blob/main/src/treeWalker/types.ts)   | The displayed directory tree and code snippet pertain to a TypeScript project centered around operations on data structures, including common operations like flatten, reduce, and pattern matching. The treeWalker subdirectory includes utilities for tree traversal. Within this, `types.ts` contains type declarations for the tree traversal context-including depth and current state-and a visitor interface for tree processing methods.                                                                                     |
| [BFS.ts](https://github.com/tbui17/iteration-utilities/blob/main/src/treeWalker/BFS.ts)       | The provided code defines the BFS class for the breadth-first search of a tree-like data structure and exports a treeBFS function that performs this traversal. It takes a data object and a visitor function as arguments. During traversal, the visitor function is applied to every node. The traversal is stopped prematurely if the breakEmitter method is called, and the iteration of a node's children is skipped if the changeEmitter method is called.                                                                     |
| [errors.ts](https://github.com/tbui17/iteration-utilities/blob/main/src/treeWalker/errors.ts) | The code defines a PathError class in the errors.ts file within the treeWalker directory in the iteration-utilities project. The class extends the base Error class and takes three parameters: current (can be string or number), path (an array that contains string or number), and opts (optional, includes any error cause). The class generates an error message detailing the unexpected path value.                                                                                                                          |

| [processingStack.ts](https://github.com/tbui17/iteration-utilities/blob/main/src/treeWalker/postDfs/processingStack.ts) | The provided code initializes a directory structure for a TypeScript project with multiple features such as tree walking algorithms, pattern matching, and set merging. The specific file `processingStack.ts` defines two classes, `ContextProcessor` and `MutatingContextProcessor`, which process data through different contexts during a tree traversal operation. The `MutatingContextProcessor` class alters its context over the run, with an option to prematurely stop the process via a break signal. |
| [index.ts](https://github.com/tbui17/iteration-utilities/blob/main/src/treeWalker/postDfs/index.ts)                     | The code is part of a project structure under the iteration-utilities directory and specifically pertains to the postDfs subdirectory of treeWalker. Within the index.ts file of postDfs, all exports from PostDFS and processingStack modules are re-exported, allowing them to be accessed directly from postDfs. This enhances modularity and simplifies import statements elsewhere in the project.                                                                                                          |
| [PostDFS.ts](https://github.com/tbui17/iteration-utilities/blob/main/src/treeWalker/postDfs/PostDFS.ts)                 | The provided code includes a function `postDFSObjectTraversal` that performs a post-order depth-first traversal of a tree-like data structure (either an object or an array), applying a visitor function to each node. Auxiliary function `loadDFSStack` prepares a processing stack for traversal. The main function manages traversal with depth and path context and conducts necessary checks before the traversal. It's purposed for running mutating operations on the data structure.                    |

| [TreeContext.ts](https://github.com/tbui17/iteration-utilities/blob/main/src/treeWalker/treeContext/TreeContext.ts)                       | The provided code defines the `TreeContext` class representing the context of a node in a tree structure. It includes methods for interacting with the node and its position within the tree. It allows obtaining the node key, value, root context, parent context and ancestors, checking if it's at the root, an array or a record, and modifying node's value. Also, it signals to break the tree traversal. Two specialized interfaces-`RecordContext` and `ArrayContext`-further define context specifics for record nodes and array nodes. |
| [treeUpdateStatus.ts](https://github.com/tbui17/iteration-utilities/blob/main/src/treeWalker/treeContext/treeUpdateStatus.ts)             | The provided code is part of a TypeScript library for tree walking operations. It defines string constants representing successful and unsuccessful statuses for tree updates and exports them as treeUpdateStatus. It also exports a function isSuccessfulTreeUpdateStatus that checks whether a given tree update status belongs to the successful statuses. The function is useful for triaging the outcome of a tree update operation.                                                                                                        |
| [objectTraversalContext.ts](https://github.com/tbui17/iteration-utilities/blob/main/src/treeWalker/treeContext/objectTraversalContext.ts) | The provided code implements an ObjectTraversalContext class in a TypeScript project. This class is meant for traversing and handling mutations on a tree-like data structure. It has methods for fetching object/array children and ancestors, breaking the traversal, merging new contexts, replacing values, and returning contexts or isAtRoot, isArray, isRecord status. The class also supports data validation during tree traversal and mutation, including handling path errors and providing update statuses.                           |
| [treeContextConstructor.ts](https://github.com/tbui17/iteration-utilities/blob/main/src/treeWalker/treeContext/treeContextConstructor.ts) | The code defines types in TypeScript for tree traversal in a codebase. It includes a general TreeContextConstructor interface used for defining a context for tree traversal. Available types include depth, path, breakEmitter function, rootContext, and context which can be an object or array. Two extensions of this interface are provided: ArrayTreeContextConstructor for array-based traversals and RecordTreeContextConstructor for object-based traversals. This promises more transparent and type-safe code.                        |
| [baseTreeContext.ts](https://github.com/tbui17/iteration-utilities/blob/main/src/treeWalker/treeContext/baseTreeContext.ts)               | The given code defines the interface `BaseTreeContext` in TypeScript, primarily used to navigate and manipulate tree-like data structures. It includes properties like depth, path, rootContext, context, parent, children, and ancestors, and methods like break, isArray, isRecord, etc. The interface enables specific operations on tree data structures, including context-specific actions like breaking traversal, checking if the context is an array or a record, and throwing an error if array or record context is absent.            |
| [index.ts](https://github.com/tbui17/iteration-utilities/blob/main/src/treeWalker/treeContext/index.ts)                                   | The code in src/treeWalker/treeContext/index.ts exports functionalities related to tree traversal from different modules in the same directory. These include the basic tree context functionality, the merger used for combining tree nodes, methods for object traversal, and mechanisms for constructing tree context and updating tree status.                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| [Merger.ts](https://github.com/tbui17/iteration-utilities/blob/main/src/treeWalker/treeContext/Merger.ts)                                 | The Merger class in this TypeScript code provides functionalities for merging arrays or objects (target and source). Depending on the type of the target and source, it handles four scenarios; merging two arrays, two objects, an object into an array, and an array into an object. It also has an optional removeExisting parameter that, when true, clears the target before merging. Each merge operation considers the type of data structures used. A static merge function is also added for simplified calling.                         |
